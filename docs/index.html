                <h2>1. Background</h2>
                &emsp; First, we will discuss the Planar and Toroidal embeddings of a graph in order to establish the vital
                features to the composition of an embedding algorithm.
                <section>
                    <h3>1a) Planar Graphs <a href="#ref1">[1: pg 12]</a> <a href="#ref3">[3: Section 9.1]</a></h3>
                    &emsp; A <a class="planar">Planar Graph</a> is a graph $G$ which can be embedded (drawn) on a plane without any crossing edges.
                    By <a class="kurT">Kuratowski's Theorem</a>, it is known that a graph $G$ is planar <i>if and only if</i> it does not
                    contain any subgraphs that are a subdivision of <a class="k5">$K_5$</a> or <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Take $G$ for example:
                    <br>
                    <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 2);">
                        <image src="resources/images/graphs/k33subo.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                        <image src="resources/images/graphs/k33sub.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>

                        <figcaption><h3>Figure 1: Non-Planar $G$ with Highlighted Subgraph</h3>
                        On the figure on the right, only the vertices which are part of the <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a> subgraph are colored red.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <br>
                    &emsp; $G$ contains a subgraph which is isomorphic to a subdivision of <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a> as illustrated above. Therefore,
                    it can be concluded that $G$ is not a <a class="planar">Planar Graph</a>. Note that many different possible subgraphs may exist,
                    but only one needs to be found in order to disqualify $G$. This feature of <a class="k5">$K_5$</a> and
                    <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a> means that they can also be referred to as a "forbidden minor" in the context of a planar embedding.

                <section>
                    <h3>1b) Toroidal Embeddings <a href="#ref3">[3: Section 10.2]</a></h3>
                    &emsp; It is relatively easy to imagine drawing a graph on a plane, but a torus can be more difficult to conceptualize. See the figure below for an illustration:
                    <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">
                        <image src="resources/images/torus-forever.gif" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                        <figcaption><h3>Figure 2: Converting a Plane to a Torus</h3></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    &emsp; Figure 2 shows the standard mapping from a Plane to a Torus; edges which reach one side of the plane, they must wrap around on the opposing side.
                    This is remenescent of early Arcade games such as Pacman. While this manipulation does not preserve distances as shown by the warping of the lines in Figure 2,
                    it is a valid manipulation for our purposes as it preserves the properties of intersection and paralellism which characterize a graph embedding.

                    <h3>1c) Toroidal Graphs <a href="#ref2">[2: pg 1]</a></h3>
                    &emsp; First, it is important to note the <a class="tor">toroidal graphs</a> are a superset of <a class="planar">planar graphs</a>: all graphs that are planar are also toroidal.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; While <a class="kurT">Kuratowski's Theorem</a> provides an elegant complete characterization of the <a class="planar">planar graphs
                    </a>, no such characterization exists for a <a class="planar">Toroidal Graph</a>. In fact, at the time that reference <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> was written,
                    there were 239,451 known distinct forbidden minors for toroidal embeddings (as opposed to the planar embedding's 2).

                <section>
                    <h3>2a) Planar Embedding Algorithms</h3>
                    &emsp; Determining if a given graph is <a class="planar">planar</a> can be accomplished (relatively) easily and quickly. To find a subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of a graph $K$
                    inside of a graph $G$ takes less than $c_1 * |V| + c_2 * |E|$ seconds for some $c_1, c_2$ where $V, E$ are the sets of edges and vertices in $G$. Because this is enough
                    to determine if a graph is <a class="planar">planar</a>, we refer to the use of <a class="kurT">Kuratowski's Theorem</a> to determine <a class="planar">planarity</a> as "linear-time" algorithm.
                    In terms of algorithmic time efficiency, this is the best-case scenario for an input of variable size.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; However, what we seek is not a <a class="planar">planarity</a> test, but an actual embedding. 
                    <br><br>
                    <section>
                        <h3>2b) Toroidal Embedding Algorithms</h3>
                        &emsp; The existence of a linear-time embeddding algorithm relies on the finite set of forbidden minors (<a class="k5">$K_5$</a> and <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a>), but remember that 
                        <a class="tor">toroidal graphs</a> have no such finite set. This means that we cannot use the same method 
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; Most toroidal embedding algorithms follow the following steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Check if $G$ is <a class="planar">planar</a>
                                <br>
                                &emsp;If so, $G$ is <a class="tor">toroidal</a> and its planar embedding is also a toroidal embedding. Done.
                                <br>
                                &emsp;If not, by <a class="kurT">Kuratowski's Theorem</a>, there must be some subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of <a class="k5">$K_5$</a> and <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a>.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
