                <h2>1. Background</h2>
                &emsp; First, we will discuss the Planar and Toroidal embeddings of a graph in order to establish the vital
                features to the composition of an embedding algorithm.
                <section>
                    <h3>1a) Planar Graphs <a href="#ref1">[1: pg 12]</a> <a href="#ref3">[3: Section 9.1]</a></h3>
                    &emsp; A <a class="planar">Planar Graph</a> is a graph $G$ which can be embedded (drawn) on a plane without any crossing edges.
                    By <a class="kurT">Kuratowski's Theorem</a>, it is known that a graph $G$ is planar <i>if and only if</i> it does not
                    contain any subgraphs that are a subdivision of <a class="k5">$K_5$</a> or <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Take $G$ for example:
                    <br>
                    <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 2);">
                        <image src="resources/images/graphs/k33subo.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                        <image src="resources/images/graphs/k33sub.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>

                        <figcaption><h3>Figure 1: Non-Planar $G$ with Highlighted Subgraph</h3>
                        On the figure on the right, only the vertices which are part of the <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a> subgraph are colored red.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <br>
                    &emsp; $G$ contains a subgraph which is isomorphic to a subdivision of <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a> as illustrated above. Therefore,
                    it can be concluded that $G$ is not a <a class="planar">Planar Graph</a>. Note that many different possible subgraphs may exist,
                    but only one needs to be found in order to disqualify $G$. This feature of <a class="k5">$K_5$</a> and
                    <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a> means that they can also be referred to as a "forbidden minor" in the context of a planar embedding.

                    <h3>1b) Toroidal Embeddings <a href="#ref3">[3: Section 10.2]</a></h3>
                    &emsp; It is relatively easy to imagine drawing a graph on a plane, but a torus can be more difficult to conceptualize. See the figure below for an illustration:
                    <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">
                        <image src="resources/images/torus-forever.gif" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                        <figcaption><h3>Figure 2: Converting a Plane to a Torus</h3></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    &emsp; Figure 2 shows the standard mapping from a Plane to a Torus; edges which reach one side of the plane, they must wrap around on the opposing side.
                    This is reminiscent of early Arcade games such as Pacman. While this manipulation does not preserve distances as shown by the warping of the lines in Figure 2,
                    it is a valid manipulation for our purposes as it preserves the properties of intersection and parallelism which characterize a graph embedding.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; It is important to note that while <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a> and <a class="k5">$K_5$</a> are <a class="planar">non-planar</a>, they can be embedded on
                    a torus.
                    <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">

                    <h3>1c) Toroidal Graphs <a href="#ref2">[2: pg 1]</a></h3>
                    &emsp; First, it is important to note the <a class="tor">toroidal graphs</a> are a superset of <a class="planar">planar graphs</a>: all graphs that are planar are also toroidal.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; While <a class="kurT">Kuratowski's Theorem</a> provides an elegant complete characterization of the <a class="planar">planar graphs
                    </a>, no such characterization exists for a <a class="planar">Toroidal Graph</a>. In fact, at the time that reference <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> was written,
                    there were 239,451 known distinct forbidden minors for toroidal embeddings (as opposed to the planar embedding's 2).

                <h2>2. Embedding Algorithms</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3>2a) Planar Embedding Algorithms <a href="#ref4">[4]</a></h3>
                    &emsp; Determining if a given graph is <a class="planar">planar</a> can be accomplished (relatively) easily and quickly. To find a subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of a graph $K$
                    inside of a graph $G$ takes less than $c_1 * |V| + c_2 * |E|$ seconds for some $c_1, c_2$ where $V, E$ are the sets of edges and vertices in $G$. Because this is enough
                    to determine if a graph is <a class="planar">planar</a>, we refer to the use of <a class="kurT">Kuratowski's Theorem</a> to determine <a class="planar">planarity</a> as "linear-time" algorithm.
                    In terms of algorithmic time efficiency, this is the best-case scenario for an input of variable size.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; However, what we seek is not a <a class="planar">planarity</a> test, but an actual embedding. There are a few different linear-time <a class="planar">planar</a> embedding algorithms, but the length of such algorithms
                    far outweigh that which is appropriate for this report. For an example of a special-case <a class="planar">planar</a> embedding algorithm, refer to <a href="#ref4">ref [4]</a> for an algorithm which embeds graphs which
                    consist solely of triangular regions.
                    <br><br>
                    <section>
                        <h3>2b) Toroidal Embedding Algorithms<a href="#ref4">[1: pg 25]</a></h3>
                        &emsp; The existence of a linear-time embedding algorithm relies on the finite set of forbidden minors (<a class="k5">$K_5$</a> and <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a>), but remember that 
                        <a class="tor">toroidal graphs</a> have no such finite set. This means that we cannot use the same method for determining <a class="tor">toroidity</a> or a <a class="tor">toroidal embedding</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; Below is an algorithm entitled "TorusEmbedBridgeEnumerative":
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Check if $G$ is <a class="planar">planar</a>
                                <br>
                                &emsp;If so, $G$ is <a class="tor">toroidal</a> and its planar embedding is also a toroidal embedding. Done!
                                <br>
                                &emsp;If not, by <a class="kurT">Kuratowski's Theorem</a>, there must be some subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of <a class="k5">$K_5$</a> and <a class="k33">$K_{3,3}$</a>.
                                We will call this subgraph $K$.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Now, we must find all of the <a class="bridge">bridges</a> in $G - E_K$ where $E_K$ contains all of $K$'s edges. Let's store them in a set called $B$.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Do the following for each <a class="distinct">distinct toroidal embedding</a> $\Pi$ of $K$:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Find all of the <a class="region">regions</a> (represented by their bounding cycles) of $\Pi$ and store in set $R$.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        For every possible connection between all <a class="bridge">bridges</a> in $B$ and <a class="region">regions</a> in $R$ where <a class="bridge">bridge</a> $b$ can separate <a class="region">region</a> $r$,
                                    </li>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            Check if all faces are <a class="planar">planar</a>
                                            <br>&emsp; If so, return current embedding. Done!
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>

                            <li>
                                If this point has been reached, there is no Toroidal embedding of $G$.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <br><br>
                    </section>
                </section>
                Now, let's try an example with $K_6$ as $G$.
                <br><br>
                <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">
                    <image src="resources/images/graphs/k6_1.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                    <figcaption><h3>$K_6$</h3></figcaption>
                </figure>
                First, we need to determine if $G$ is <a class="planar">planar</a>. Using the aforementioned linear-time planarity algorithm, we find the following subgroup $K_5$ (later to be 
                referred to as $K$) indicated by the red vertices:
                <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">
                    <image src="resources/images/graphs/k6_2.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                    <figcaption><h3>$K_6$ with $K_5$ highlighted</h3></figcaption>
                </figure>
                Now, we need to find the <a class="bridge">bridges</a> in $G$ if we take away all the edges in subgraph $K$.
                <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">
                    <image src="resources/images/graphs/k6_3.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                    <figcaption><h3>$K_6$ with set $B$ in black</h3></figcaption>
                </figure>
                Next, we need to choose a toroidal embedding $\Pi$ of the subgraph $K$.
                <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">
                    <image src="resources/images/graphs/k6_4.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                    <figcaption><h3>$K_5$ embedded onto a torus</h3></figcaption>
                </figure>
                To continue, we need to separate each <a class="region">region</a> $r$ using each eligible <a class="bridge">bridge</a> $b \in B$.
                <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">
                    <image src="resources/images/graphs/k6_5.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                    <figcaption><h3>$K_5$ embedded onto a torus with regions labeled</h3></figcaption>
                </figure>
                Let's try placing the extra vertex and separating <a class="region">region</a> $r_i$ for each <a class="bridge">bridge</a> $b_u$.
                <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">
                    <image src="resources/images/graphs/k6_6.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                    <figcaption><h3>$G$ embedded(?) onto a torus</h3></figcaption>
                </figure>
                This is obviously not toroidal, as there are many intersections (and there is nowhere we can easily put the new vertex).
                This time, let's place the vertex in the center and segment <a class="region">region</a> $5$ with each <a class="bridge">bridge</a>.
                <figure style="margin: auto; width: calc(262px * 1);">
                    <image src="resources/images/graphs/k6_7.svg" style="width: 256px; border: 1px solid black;"></image>
                    <figcaption><h3>$G$ embedded(?) onto a torus</h3></figcaption>
                </figure>
                It looks like we got it on the second try!
                <br><br>
                <hr>
                <br>This convenient guessing made the algorithm terminate rather quickly, but the worst case scenario for this method requires going through
                every single possible embedding of $K_5$ and every possible permutation of $b \rightarrow r$ mappings.
                <br><br> There can be significant speed-ups using two potential methods: better region intersection selection and memoization.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Region selection</b>:
                        <br>
                        &emsp;If we were only to select regions which would allow us to place the added vertices into a single region (and not in-between several as
                        in our first example), there would be a significant reduction in the number of cases required to try.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Memoization</b>:
                        <br>
                        &emsp;Despite the infinite number of forbidden minors for a toroidal graph, there can only be finitely many for a graph of a set size. The quickest
                        algorithms for most toroidal graphs rely on this fact and check graphs of reasonable size and order for forbidden minors. This is not, however,
                        an exhaustive solution, so many efficient programs rely on a method resembling the aforementioned algorithm in a case where the size of a graph is
                        too large. If the graph is not toroidal but did not have any of the forbidden minors, it can be added to the set of forbidden minors. For most
                        applications, this approach will be the most approachable and efficient.
